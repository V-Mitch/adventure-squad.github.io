## How to:

**Add a post**: under _posts, add a .md file with your post (easiest is to copy an existing one and use that as a template.) Posts are written in markdown, which you can edit in an editor of your choice (I use VS Code with the markdown plugin that allows you to edit files live like the image below. 
Once you're done editing a post, Push it to the main branch in github, and the website will automatically deploy it after a few minutes.
