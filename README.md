## How to:

**Add a post**: under _posts, add a .md file with your post (easiest is to copy an existing one and use that as a template.) Posts are written in markdown, which you can edit in an editor of your choice (I use VS Code with the markdown plugin that allows you to edit files live like the image below. 
Once you're done editing a post, Push it to the main branch in github, and the website will automatically deploy it after a few minutes.


### Reduce file size of a gpx
1. Go to https://gpx.studio/ and upload your file
2. Use the minify tool (looks like a little funnel) and reduce the number of tracking points.
3. Download your file (ideally should be under 50kb for fast embedding)


### Host a new video or photo 
1. Go to https://cloudinary.com/
2. Login using adventuresquad github account
3. Upload videos to video folder
4. Embed into a post using raw URL (see example in existing posts)
